abstract = {This article introduces a resampling procedure called the stationary$\backslash$nbootstrap as a means of calculating standard errors of estimators$\backslash$nand constructing confidence regions for parameters based on weakly$\backslash$ndependent stationary observations. Previously, a technique based$\backslash$non resampling blocks of consecutive observations was introduced to$\backslash$nconstruct confidence intervals for a parameter of the m-dimensional$\backslash$njoint distribution of m consecutive observations, where m is fixed.$\backslash$nThis procedure has been generalized by constructing a "blocks of$\backslash$nblocks" resampling scheme that yields asymptotically valid procedures$\backslash$neven for a multivariate parameter of the whole (i.e., infinite-dimensional)$\backslash$njoint distribution of the stationary sequence of observations. These$\backslash$nmethods share the construction of resampling blocks of observations$\backslash$nto form a pseudo-time series, so that the statistic of interest may$\backslash$nbe recalculated based on the resampled data set. But in the context$\backslash$nof applying this method to stationary data, it is natural to require$\backslash$nthe resampled pseudo-time series to be stationary (conditional on$\backslash$nthe original data) as well. Although the aforementioned procedures$\backslash$nlack this property, the stationary procedure developed here is indeed$\backslash$nstationary and possesses other desirable properties. The stationary$\backslash$nprocedure is based on resampling blocks of random length, where the$\backslash$nlength of each block has a geometric distribution. In this article,$\backslash$nfundamental consistency and weak convergence properties of the stationary$\backslash$nresampling scheme are developed.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a method to address the longstanding problem of lack of monotonicity in estimation of conditional and structural quantile functions, also known as the quantile crossing problem (Bassett and Koenker (1982)). The method consists in sorting or monotone rearranging the original estimated non-monotone curve into a monotone rearranged curve. We show that the rearranged curve is closer to the true quantile curve than the original curve in finite samples, establish a functional delta method for rearrangement-related operators, and derive functional limit theory for the entire rearranged curve and its functionals. We also establish validity of the bootstrap for estimating the limit law of the entire rearranged curve and its functionals. Our limit results are generic in that they apply to every estimator of a monotone function, provided that the estimator satisfies a functional central limit theorem and the function satisfies some smoothness conditions. Consequently, our results apply to estimation of other econometric functions with monotonicity restrictions, such as demand, production, distribution, and structural distribution functions. We illustrate the results with an application to estimation of structural distribution and quantile functions using data on Vietnam veteran status and earnings.},

@techreport{RePEc:imf:imfwpa:18/180,
abstract = {Using panel quantile regressions for 11 advanced and 10 emerging market economies, we show that the conditional distribution of GDP growth depends on financial conditions, with growth-at-risk (GaR)—defined as growth at the lower 5th percentile—more responsive than the median or upper percentiles. In addition, the term structure of GaR features an intertemporal tradeoff: GaR is higher in the short run; but lower in the medium run when initial financial conditions are loose relative to typical levels, and the tradeoff is amplified by a credit boom. This shift in the growth distribution generally is not incorporated when solving dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models with macrofinancial linkages, which suggests downside risks to GDP growth are systematically underestimated.},

@techreport{Alessandri2019,
abstract = {This paper studies the relationship between financial conditions and economic activity in Italy using quantile regression techniques in the spirit of Adrian, Boryachenko and Giannone (2019). We exploit the volatility of the 2008-2012 period to assess the plausibility of ‘tail' predictions obtained from a broad range of financial indicators. We find that, although spikes in financial distress are typically followed by economic contractions, using this relationship for out-of-sample forecasting is not trivial. To some extent, the models predict the slowdowns experienced by Italy after 2008, but the forecasts are volatile, their quality varies across indicators and horizons, and the predictions tend to overestimate the likelihood of an upcoming recession. As such, these tools represent a complement to, rather than a substitute for, an articulated and diversified systemic risk assessment framework.},

@techreport{Aikman2019,
abstract = {How can macroeconomic tail risks originating from financial vulnerabilities be monitored systematically over time? This question lies at the heart of operationalising the macroprudential policy regimes that have developed around the world in response to the global financial crisis. Using quantile regressions applied to a panel dataset of 16 advanced economies, we examine how downside risk to growth over the medium term, GDP-at-Risk, is affected by a set of macroprudential indicators. We find that credit booms, property price booms and wide current account deficits each pose material downside risks to growth at horizons of three to five years. We find that such downside risks can be partiall y mitigated, however, by increasing the capitalisation of the banking system. We estimate that across our sample of countries, GDP-at-Risk, defined as the 5th quantile of the projected GDP growth distribution over three years, on average deteriorated by around 4.5 percentage points cumulatively in the run-up to the crisis. Our estimates suggest that an increase in bank capital equivalent to a countercyclical capital buffer rate of 2.5{\%} (5{\%}) would have been sufficient to mitigate up to 20{\%} (40{\%}) of this increase in medium-term macroeconomic tail risk.},

We use a broad set of financial indicators to capture cyclical systemic risk in the financial system and different quantile regression models to characterise their effects on the medium-term growth distribution.

Among financial indicators, credit growth has the most significant effect on downside risks to growth. We also find that downside risks are higher under a fixed exchange rate regime.

First, we summarise how financial indicators and growth-at-risk have evolved over time in Norway and how this framework can be used to quantify and communicate risks to the economic outlook.

We find that excessive bank credit growth is associated with lower future real GDP growth in the medium term especially on the low quantiles of growth distribution. Moreover, worsening of both global financial conditions and external conditions are associated with lower future growth in the short term, especially at the high quantiles of growth distribution. Country-specific results are broadly in line with ECCU-wide results, with some variation potentially due to the strong Citizenship-By-Investment program inflows and lack of credit union data. The establishment of a macroprudential framework in the ECCU would need to pay close attention to credit growth not only of banks but also credit unions and continue to monitor global and external conditions.},

By combining a quantile regression of GDP growth with a vector autoregression, we show that monetary and macroprudential policy shocks can reduce credit growth and thus GDP tail risk. So policymakers concerned about GDP tail risk would choose a tighter policy stance at the expense of macroeconomic stability. Using Canadian data, we show how our framework can add tail event information to projection models that ignore them and give policy-makers a tool to communicate the trade-offs they face},

We assess these composite measures relative to their historical distributions. And we present preliminary evidence for how they influence downside risks to economic growth and different horizons. The measures provide an intuitive description of the evolution of the financial cycle of the past three decades.
