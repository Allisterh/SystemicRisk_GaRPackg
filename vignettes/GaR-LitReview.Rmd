@Alessandri2019 divide the explanatory variables to two broad categories: real activity which is represented by GDP (or IP or Itacoin) and financial activity.
The financial activity is represented both by composite index such as FCI and simpler indices such as spreads (for example sovereign spread). It seems that
real activity has an important autoregressive component, including lags of real
activity variable significantly diminishes that explanatory power of financial
variables. Another important finding is the contribution of credit gap, this contribution generally rises over the forecasting horizon
(positive contribution at one to two years ahead).
