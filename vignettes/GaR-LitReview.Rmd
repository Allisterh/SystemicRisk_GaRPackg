@Alessandri2019 use the GaR framework to study the relationship between
financial conditions and economic activity in Italy. The authors findings
confirm the known result that this relationship is more pronounced for the left
tail of the growth distribution. However the authors do not find evidence of the
"volatility paradox", the association between financial conditions and economic
growth is negative across all the time horizons. From methodological point the
article divides the explanatory variables to two broad categories: 
real activity which is represented by GDP (or IP or Itacoin) and
financial activity. The financial activity is represented both by composite
index such as FCI and simpler indices such as spreads
(for example sovereign spread).  Another important finding is the contribution of credit gap, this contribution generally rises over the forecasting horizon
(positive contribution at one to two years ahead). The authors conclude that the
forecast are quite volatile and the use of the model is challenging.

@Aikman2019 perform a panel study of 16 advanced countries for 1980-2017 period.
The authors do not find evidence of "volatility paradox".Namely they find that 
the tightening in financial conditions depress growth in the near term 
(up to one year horizon) but has no effect at longer horizons. A more detailed
analysis reveleas that "excessive" credit, house price growth and current account
deficit has detremintal effect at 3 year horizon. This finding is in line with
early warnings literature that finds that these variables predict financial
(banking) crises. The authors suggest that if the "volatility paradox"
operates through loose financial conditions that support credit and house price
increase and thus curb economic growth then direct inclusion of these variables
in the regression eliminates the paradox
