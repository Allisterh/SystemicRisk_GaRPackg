The Growth at Risk framework relates to a strand of literature that study the
relationship between financial conditions and economic activity. Two main
stylized facts of this literature are the "volatility paradox" and the
"risk asymmetry". The "volatility paradox" is a phenomenon where accommodating
financial conditions stimulate growth in the short term but depress growth in
the long term due to the realization of accumulated risks. The "risk asymmetry"
refers to the fact that the left tail of the forecasted growth distribution 
(the depressed growth scenarios) is quite volatile relative to the right
tail of the distribution meaning that the downside growth risk is much more
severe than upside risk.


@Alessandri2019 apply the GaR framework to the Italian economy.
The authors find that the downside risk (left tail of the growth distribution)
is more pronounced relative to upside risk and thus confirm the "risk asymmetry"
finding. The authors however do not find supporting evidence of the "volatility
paradox", according to their results, the association between financial
conditions and economic growth is negative across all the time horizons. 
The sample period is approximately\footnote{Different indicators span different
time periods} 1990Q3-2018Q4 and includes two major crises events : the Global
Financial Crisis and the Sovereign Debt Crisis. The authors note that some of
the results are influenced by the crises periods. From methodological perspective
the article divides the explanatory variables to two broad categories: 
real activity which is represented by GDP (or IP or Itacoin) and financial
activity. Financial activity is represented either by composite indices such as
FCI or simpler indices such as spreads (for example sovereign spread). Another
important finding is the positive contribution (at one to two years ahead) of
credit gap that increases over the forecasting horizon. The authors also note
that the forecasts are quite volatile and the use of the model is challenging.

@Aikman2018 use the GaR framework to identify risks to the UK financial
stability. The researches introduce 29 financial risk indicators and group them
to three categories: private non financial sector leverage, asset valuations and
new credit terms and conditions. The results suggest that private sector
leverage (represented mainly by smoothed credit to GDP) increase downside risk
for future growth but only at short term horizon (1-4 quarters ahead), a finding
contrary to "volatility paradox". Asset valuation on the other hand support the
"volatility paradox" - short term (1 quarter) positive  association becomes
negative at long term (12 quarters).

@Aikman2019 perform a panel study of 16 advanced countries\footnote{These 
countries are: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, 
Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United 
Kingdom and the United States} for 1980-2017 period. The authors concentrate
on medium term (3 year horizon) as being the most relevant from macro-prudential
policy perspective. The analysis reveals that at medium term "excessive" credit
growth, house price growth and current account deficit have detrimental effect
on GDP growth (credit and current account's coefficients are negative across all 
horizons). This finding is in line with early warnings literature that finds that
these variables predict financial (banking) crises. As for financial conditions,
the finding is that tightening in financial conditions depress growth in the 
near term (up to one year horizon) but has no effect at longer horizons. The 
authors suggest that if the "volatility paradox" operates through loose financial 
conditions that support credit and house price increase and thus curb economic
growth then direct inclusion of these variables in the regression eliminates
the effect of financial conditions. The analysis produces limited evidence of
"risk asymmetry", only credit's coefficient is larger in magnitude at the 5th
percentile.

@Chen2019 estimate the ability of financial variables to forecast 
macroeconomic variables using panel data. The authors find that in a univariate
regression, credit growth has significant positive contribution at the short term
(1 quarter and 4 quarter horizon). Once house price and stock price are included
the four-quarter association becomes insignificant. The authors compare
forecasting accuracy of panel coefficient vs individual country regressions and
find that panel regression perform better out of sample
(the result is the other way around in sample). Corporate bond yield curb
future growth both at one and four quarter horizon. The authors find that the
forecast of the model outperform the forecast published by IMF in World 
Economic Outlook. Another important finding is that using a factor model (instead
of simple regression) by collapsing the financial variables into one factor using
PCA improves forecast accuracy.


Growth at risk framework was also implemented in the developing countries.
@Komatsuzaki2019 apply this methodology to the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union
(ECCU). Unfortunately their sample is quite limited: the estimation period is
2001-2017 and for some countries actual GDP growth is not available and estimated
values are used instead. The authors divide the 11 explanatory variables to 6
partitions. The partitions mainly reflect the usual categories:
Global vs Domestic and Real vs Financial. In the short term (1 year ahead) the
credit growth (represented by bank credit to GDP) exhibits 
"reverse risk asymmetry" - the left tail coefficients are positive (and smaller
in size) while right tail coefficients are negative (and larger in absolute
value). In the long term (3 year horizon) the
coefficients are negative across the entire distribution. This is supporting
evidence of the "volatility paradox" but only for the left tail of the growth
distribution. 

@Bespalova2019 use the GaR framework for the Dominican Republic which is a small
open economy characterized by capital account and financial market openness.
The authors data spans the period 1996-2018. There are 32 explanatory variables
which are grouped into 5 partitions.
