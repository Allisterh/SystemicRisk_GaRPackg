The Growth at Risk framework relates to a strand of literature that study the
relationship between financial conditions and economic activity. Two main
stylized facts of this literature are the "volatility paradox" and the
"risk asymmetry". The "volatility paradox" is a phenomenon where accommodating
financial conditions stimulate growth in the short term but depress growth in
the long term due to realization of accumulated risks. The "risk asymmetry"
refers to the fact the left tail of the forecasted growth distribution 
(the depressed growth scenarios) is quite volatile relative to the right
tail of the distribution meaning that the downside growth risk is much more
severe than upside risk.


@Alessandri2019 apply the GaR framework to the Italian economy. The authors find that this
relationship is more pronounced for the left tail of the growth distribution and
thus confirm the "risk asymmetry" finding. The authors however do not find
supporting evidence of the "volatility paradox", according to their results the
association between financial conditions and economic growth is negative across
all the time horizons. From methodological point the article divides the 
explanatory variables to two broad categories: real activity which is 
represented by GDP (or IP or Itacoin) and financial activity. Financial 
activity is represented both by composite index such as FCI and simpler indices
such as spreads (for example sovereign spread). Another important finding is
the contribution of credit gap, this contribution generally rises over the
forecasting horizon (positive contribution at one to two years ahead). The
authors conclude that the forecast are quite volatile and the use of the model
is challenging.

@Aikman2019 perform a panel study of 16 advanced countries for 1980-2017 period.
Their analysis reveals that "excessive" credit, house price growth and
current account deficit has detrimental effect at 3 year horizon. This finding
 is in line with early warnings literature that finds that these variables
predict financial (banking) crises. As for financial conditions, the finding is
that tightening in financial conditions depress growth in the near term
(up to one year horizon) but has no effect at longer horizons. The authors 
suggest that if the "volatility paradox" operates through loose financial 
conditions that support credit and house price increase and thus curb economic
growth then direct inclusion of these variables in the regression eliminates
the paradox.

@Chen2019 estimate the ability of financial variables to forecast 
macroeconomic variables using panel data . The authors find that in a univariate regression
credit growth has significant explanatory power at short term (1 quarter and 4
quarter horizon). Once house price and stock price are included the four-quarter
association becomes insignificant. The authors compare forecasting accuracy of
panel coefficient vs individual country regressions and find that panel
regression perform better out of sample
(the result is the other way around in sample). Corporate bond yield curbs
future growth both at one and four quarter horizon. The authors find that the
forecast of the model outperform the forecast published by IMF in World 
Economic Outlook. Another important finding is that using a factor model (instead
of simle regression) by collapsing the financial variables into one factor using
PCA imporoves forecast accuracy.
