@Alessandri2019 use the GaR framework to study the relationship between
financial conditions and economic activity in Italy. The authors findings
confirm the known result that this relationship is more pronounced for the left
tail of the growth distribution. However the authors do not find evidence of the
"volatility paradox", the association between financial conditions and economic
growth is negative across all the time horizons. From methodological point the
article divides the explanatory variables to two broad categories: 
real activity which is represented by GDP (or IP or Itacoin) and
financial activity. The financial activity is represented both by composite
index such as FCI and simpler indices such as spreads
(for example sovereign spread).  Another important finding is the contribution of credit gap, this contribution generally rises over the forecasting horizon
(positive contribution at one to two years ahead). The authors conclude that the
forecast are quite volatile and the use of the model is challenging.
